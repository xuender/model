# 激励 Incentives (“Perhaps the most important rule in management…”

Charlie Munger wrote in Poor Charlie’s Almanack:

“Perhaps the most important rule in management is to get the incentives right.” (see 30+ Charlie Munger Quotes).

Charlie argues that people respond most strongly to what they view as their incentive or disincentive.

In business, there is almost always someone else involved in whatever you are trying to do. Munger recommends that you always reflect on:

“What is someone getting out of this.”

Charlie gives a few business examples of incentive bias (source: Poor Charlie’s Almanack).

FedEx — he said that they couldn’t get the planes to shift packages from plane to plane in a timely manner.

The problem was that the workers were being paid per hour. When FedEx changed to paying the workers per shift, the workers were able to to shift packages faster.

Xerox — Joe Wilson had to return to Xerox to help figure out why their older, inferior copy machines were outperforming their newer, better machines. Wilson found the explanation in a perverse commission structure that incentivized selling the older machines more than the new machines.

Munger has talked about incentive bias related to two clients his father (an attorney) had:

Grant McFayden — McFayden owned a Ford dealership and was a brilliant man of enormous charm and integrity and who made excellent decisions.
Mr X — Mr. X (Munger leaves out his name) was a blowhard, overreaching, pompous, difficult man.
Charlie, when he was 14, asked his dad why he did so much work for Mr. X, the blowhard, instead of doing more work for wonderful men like McFayden.

Charlies says his father told him:

“Grant McFayden treats his employees right, his customers right, and his problems right. If he gets involved with a psychotic, he quickly walks over to where the psychotic is and works out an exit as fast as he can. Therefore, Grant McFayden doesn’t have enough remunerative law business to keep you in Coca-Cola. But Mr. X is a walking minefield of wonderful legal business.”

Translation: lawyers have a much stronger financial incentive to represent clients who get in trouble and even break the law and will likely see less financial gain from working for highly ethical clients.

“That’s what partly drove me out the profession,” Charlie wrote in Poor Charlie’s Almanack.

For a sports example of incentives, check out Are Cubbie Fans The Reason The Cubs Have Sucked For 100+ Years? for a fascinating theory on why the Chicago Cubs under-performed for so long (in short, they theory is that the Cubs organization has less of an incentive to win because the fans show up whether they win or lose).

Disincentives are equally important. Charlie suggests, in Poor Charlie’s Almanack, that a “very significant fraction of the people in the world will steal if:

A) it’s very easy to do and

B) there’s practically no chance of being caught

To succeed in business, you need to disincentevize/discourage a negative behavior such as stealing by, for example, making it extremely difficult to do and likely to be detected (that’s usually accomplished through systems and controls).

查理·芒格在《可怜的查理年鉴》中写道：

“也许管理中最重要的规则是正确的激励措施。”（见30+查理•芒格引述）。

查理认为，人们对自己认为的激励或抑制反应最强烈。

在商界，几乎总是有其他人参与你想做的事情。芒格建议，你要时刻反思：

“有人从中得到了什么？”

Charlie给出了一些激励偏差的商业例子（来源：可怜的Charlie年鉴）。

联邦快递-他说，他们无法让飞机及时将包裹从一架飞机转移到另一架飞机。

问题是工人的工资是按小时计算的。当联邦快递改为每班付工人工资时，工人们能够更快地转移包裹。

施乐公司-乔·威尔逊不得不回到施乐公司，帮助他们弄清楚为什么旧的、劣质的复印机比新的、更好的复印机性能更好。威尔逊在一个不合理的佣金结构中找到了这个解释，这种结构激励着销售旧机器多于新机器。

芒格谈到了他父亲（一名律师）拥有的两个客户的激励偏好：

格兰特·麦克费登——麦克费登拥有一家福特汽车经销商，是一个具有巨大魅力和正直的聪明人，他做出了卓越的决定。

X先生——X先生（芒格不提他的名字）是个爱吹牛、反应过度、自大、难相处的人。

查理14岁的时候问他爸爸，为什么他要为吹牛的X先生做这么多工作，而不是为像麦克费登这样的好男人做更多的工作。

查理说他父亲告诉他：

格兰特·麦克费登对待员工、顾客和问题都是正确的。如果他和一个精神病患者有牵连，他会很快走到精神病患者所在的地方，并尽可能快地找到一个出口。因此，格兰特·麦克费登没有足够的报酬来维持你在可口可乐的生意。但X先生是一个活跃的雷区，有着出色的法律业务。”

翻译：律师有更强大的财务激励来代表那些陷入困境甚至违法的客户，并且很可能从为高度道德的客户工作中看到更少的财务收益。

查理在《可怜的查理年鉴》中写道：“这在一定程度上使我失去了这份工作。

作为一个激励的体育例子，看看小熊队的球迷们是不是小熊队已经吸了100多年血的原因？关于为什么芝加哥小熊队表现不佳的原因有一个有趣的理论（简而言之，他们的理论是小熊队组织没有太多的动力去赢得比赛，因为无论他们赢还是输，球迷都会出现）。

抑制因素同样重要。查理在《可怜的查理年鉴》中建议，“如果：

A） 很容易做到
B） 几乎不可能被抓住

为了在商业上取得成功，你需要去中心化/阻止一些消极的行为，比如偷窃，这使得你很难去做并且很可能被发现（通常是通过系统和控制来完成的）。
