# 自我利益 Self-Interest

Munger says one of his favorite “human misjudgments”is how the brain subconsciously will decide that what’s good for the holder of the brain is good for everyone else.

Some folks refer to this as people dialing into the WIIFM radio station (as in”What’s In It For Me”)

芒格说，他最喜欢的“人类错误判断”之一是大脑如何下意识地决定对大脑持有者有利的东西对其他人都有利。

有些人把这称为拨入WIIFM电台的人（如“为我做的事”一文）
