# 巴甫洛夫联想 Pavlovian Association

When the experience of one thing leads to the effect of another — after repeatedly being paired together — that is called Pavlovian Association (after Ivan Pavlov’s classical conditioning).

Munger says that Paley of CBS was a business example of this: he didn’t want to hear what he didn’t like to hear. Those around him learned that and soon told him only what he wanted to hear.

Eventually that led to a decline in market share for CBS (which was once the only major tv network).
