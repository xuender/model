# 大数定律 Law Of Large Numbers (aka The Law of Averages)

The law of large numbers indicates that the higher the number of times something is performed, the more likely it will receive something close to the average of the results.

For example, if you rolled a six-sided die, the average results you can expect is the average of the 6 outcomes is a 3.5 ( (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6)/6. The law of large numbers indicates that your average roll will get closer and closer to 3.5 the more you roll the dice!

That’s why when you’re winning at a casino (or anywhere else where “the house” takes its cut), you should quit early — otherwise, the law of large numbers will eventually kick in: the more bets you make the closer you will get to netting a loss (since a casino is designed to have a greater than 50/50 edge over you).

But don’t fall victim to what’s called the “gambler’s fallacy”. In the gambler’s fallacy, if you flip a coin 5 times, and it comes up heads, some folks falsely believe that then the 6th toss is more likely to come up tails. That’s not really true. Each single event is still a 50/50 probability. The law of large numbers instead says that the more you flip the coin the closer the average result will be to heads/tails being at a 50/50 split.

For example, if you tossed a coin just 10 times, you could easily get 8 heads (80%) and 2 tails (20%); but if you tossed a coin 1,000 times, the law of large numbers smooths out the results so that the heads/tails results would be closer to the average of 50%.

As you take more and more samples, the average of that sample will converge to the expected value.

The law of numbers is also used to explain how the larger the number you have the more you have to work to grow that number.

For example, if Facebook has $1 billion in profits and Berkshire Hathaway has $10 billion in profits, the law of numbers indicates that Facebook will have an easier time growing profits 10% per year over the next 1o years  than Berkshire could (all other things equal) because Berkshire’s starting base is so much larger.

大数定律表明，一件事执行的次数越多，它得到接近平均结果的东西的可能性就越大。

例如，如果您滚动一个六边模具，您可以预期的平均结果是6个结果的平均值是3.5（（1+2+3+4+5+6）/6。大数定律表明你掷骰子的次数越多，你的平均骰子数就越接近3.5！

这就是为什么当你在赌场（或其他任何“房子”接受削减的地方）赢钱的时候，你应该早点退出——否则，大数定律最终会生效：你下的赌注越多，你就越接近净亏（因为赌场的设计比你高出50/50）。

但不要成为所谓“赌徒谬论”的牺牲品。在赌徒的谬论中，如果你把一枚硬币掷了5次，结果它是正面的，有些人错误地认为，第6次掷硬币更可能出现反面。那不是真的。每一个事件的概率仍然是50/50。相反，大数定律说，你掷硬币越多，平均结果就越接近平分的正面/反面。

例如，如果你只掷一枚硬币10次，你可以很容易地得到8个正面（80%）和2个反面（20%）；但是如果你掷一枚硬币1000次，大数定律会使结果平滑，这样正面/反面的结果会接近50%的平均值。

当您采集越来越多的样本时，该样本的平均值将收敛到预期值。

数字定律也被用来解释你拥有的数字越大，你就越需要努力去增加这个数字。

例如，如果Facebook有10亿美元的利润，而伯克希尔哈撒韦公司有100亿美元的利润，那么根据数字法则，Facebook在未来10年内每年增长10%的利润要比伯克希尔公司（其他条件都一样）容易得多，因为伯克希尔公司的起点要大得多。
