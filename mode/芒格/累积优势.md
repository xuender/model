# 累积优势 Cumulative Advantage (aka The Matthew Effect or “The rich get richer”)

The Principle of Cumulative Advantage, as noted on Thwink.org, states that:

“…once a social agent gains a small advantage over other agents, that advantage will compound over time into an increasingly larger advantage.”

Cumulative Advantage is sometimes known as The Matthew Effect or Accumulated Advantage or “the rich get richer, the poor get poorer”.

A common example of Cumulative Advantage is that a prize will almost always be awarded to the most senior researcher involved in a project, even if all the work was done by a graduate student. The senior researched has accumulated that advantage.

The game of Monopoly is often cited as Cumulative Advantage as outlined in The Matthew Effect: How Advantage Begets Further Advantage:

In the board game of Monopoly, all players begin with equal resources. Yet equal opportunity at the start soon gives way to extreme inequalities in the distribution of resources. Though there may be ups and downs along the way, the richer players tend to get richer, and the poorer players poorer, until eventually the richest player has monopolized all resources and the poor are left with nothing at all.

As successful players accumulate income-producing property through a combination of skill and luck, their cumulative advantages allow them to reinvest new income in accumulating still more property, producing still more new income. This snowballing pattern of self-amplifying accumulation results in a Matthew effect that ultimately allows the most advantaged player to crush all opponents.

The sociologist Leonard Beeghly (1989) invites us to imagine a slight variation on the game of Monopoly that more nearly resembles real life. In Beeghly’s version, each player begins with a different sum of money. Let us suppose hypothetically that some players begin the game with $5,000, others begin with $1,000, and still others with only $500.

Those who begin with $5,000 enjoy a considerable head start on the competition. They can well afford to acquire every property they land on, and they soon own a disproportionate share of the income-producing properties on the board. Those who follow after them are less able to afford properties of their own, and instead usually find themselves spending their limited resources in rent payments, enriching the large owners and impoverishing themselves in the process.

The laws of probability virtually ensure that under these conditions, the rich will get richer and the poor poorer, and through no special virtue or vice of their own. Initial advantages are parlayed into greater advantages, creating a widening gap between haves and have-nots—or, more precisely, between have-mores and have-lesses—through time.

Here’s another definition from the New York Times article Is Justin Timberlake a Product of Cumulative Advantage?:

“This means that if one object happens to be slightly more popular than another at just the right point, it will tend to become more popular still. As a result, even tiny, random fluctuations can blow up, generating potentially enormous long-run differences among even indistinguishable competitors — a phenomenon that is similar in some ways to the famous “butterfly effect” from chaos theory.”

累积优势原则，如Thwink.org网站，声明：

“……一旦一个社会代理人获得了比其他代理人小的优势，随着时间的推移，这种优势将复合为越来越大的优势。”

累积优势有时被称为马太效应或累积优势或“富人越富，穷人越穷”。

累积优势的一个常见例子是，即使所有的工作都是由研究生完成的，也几乎总是会有奖给参与某个项目的最高级研究员。这位资深研究人员已经积累了这种优势。

垄断游戏通常被称为马太效应中概述的累积优势：优势如何产生进一步的优势：

在垄断的棋盘游戏中，所有的玩家都从平等的资源开始。然而，一开始的平等机会很快就让位于资源分配的极端不平等。虽然一路上可能会有起起落落，但越富有的玩家往往越富有，越贫穷的玩家越贫穷，直到最后最富有的玩家垄断了所有资源，穷人一无所有。

当成功的玩家通过技能和运气的结合积累了产生收入的财产时，他们累积的优势使他们能够将新的收入再投资于积累更多的财产，从而产生更多的新收入。这种自我放大积累的滚雪球模式产生了马太效应，最终让最有优势的玩家压垮所有对手。

社会学家伦纳德·比格利（Leonard Beeghly，1989）邀请我们想象一下垄断游戏的细微变化，这种变化更接近于现实生活。在Beeghly的版本中，每个玩家从一笔不同的钱开始。假设有些玩家以5000美元开始游戏，有些玩家以1000美元开始游戏，还有一些玩家只有500美元。

那些以5000美元起家的人在竞争中享有相当大的领先优势。他们完全可以负担得起他们所拥有的每一处房产，而且他们很快就拥有了董事会中不相称的收入来源房产份额。那些追随他们的人买不起自己的房产，相反，他们通常会发现自己将有限的资源用于支付租金，在这个过程中使大业主致富，使自己贫穷。

概率定律实际上确保在这些条件下，富人会变得更富有，穷人会变得更穷，而不是通过他们自己的特殊美德或缺点。最初的优势被转化为更大的优势，造成贫富差距不断扩大，或者更准确地说，随着时间的推移，贫富差距不断扩大。

《纽约时报》的另一篇文章对贾斯汀·汀布莱克的定义是“累积优势”的产物吗？:

“这意味着，如果一个对象恰好在适当的时候比另一个稍微受欢迎，那么它将更受欢迎。结果，即使是微小的随机波动也可能爆发，在甚至无法区分的竞争对手之间产生潜在的巨大长期差异——这种现象在某些方面类似于混沌理论中著名的“蝴蝶效应”
